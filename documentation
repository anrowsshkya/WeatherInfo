#  Documentation (Approach & Thought Process)
I started by breaking down the task into small steps. First, I integrated the OpenWeather API and tested fetching data for a city. Once I confirmed the API call worked, I added a search input so users could type in any city.  
For displaying the weather, I created a reusable WeatherCard that shows temperature, condition, humidity, and an icon. I kept the design simple but added a feature where the background image changes based on the weather condition (e.g., sunny background for clear weather, rainy background for rain). This makes the app more visually appealing.  

I also made sure to handle errors properly. If the user enters a wrong city name, the app displays an error message instead of breaking.  

Responsiveness was another focus. So I used CSS to make sure that it works well both on desktop and mobile without needing heavy frameworks.

Some extra ideas I considered:
- Making the user be able to view past and future weather data.
- Displaying the image of the respective city in the background with exact weather conditions of that location.  

Overall, my approach was to keep the app clean, functional, and user-friendly while sticking to the requirements. The project structure is organized so that itâ€™s easy to add new features later.
